# üìã AI-Powered Task List System

## Overview

The AI-Powered Task List system is a smart, sticky note-style task management feature integrated into your dashboard. It uses AI to automatically detect and create tasks from natural language text, updates your knowledge base, and provides real-time notifications.

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **AI Task Detection**

- **Smart Extraction**: AI extracts task title, description, priority, tags, and due dates from natural language
- **Multi-Task Support**: Detects and creates multiple tasks from a single text input
- **Task Suggestions**: Shows AI suggestions before creating tasks

### 2. **Sticky Note UI**
- **Floating Panel**: Task list appears as a floating panel on the right side of the dashboard
- **Collapsible**: Can be minimized to a small icon or expanded to full view
- **Beautiful Design**: Glass morphism effect with purple gradient theme
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion animations for a polished experience

### 3. **Task Management**
- **Create Tasks**: Manually or automatically via AI
- **Update Status**: Toggle between pending, in_progress, and completed
- **Priority Levels**: Low, Medium, High with color-coded badges
- **Tags**: Add multiple tags to organize tasks
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks you no longer need
- **Filter Options**: View all, pending, or completed tasks

### 4. **Knowledge Base Integration**
- **Automatic Indexing**: Every task is automatically added to the knowledge base
- **Searchable**: Tasks become part of your company's searchable knowledge
- **Document Creation**: Each task creates a document in the knowledge base with full metadata

### 5. **Notification System**
- **Real-time Alerts**: Get notifications for task creation, completion, updates, and deletions
- **Notification Bell**: Bell icon in the navigation bar with unread count badge
- **Notification Panel**: Beautiful dropdown panel showing all recent notifications

```
You are a task analysis assistant. Analyze the given text and extract task information.
Return a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "isTask": boolean,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "title": "brief task title",
      "description": "detailed description",
      "priority": "low" | "medium" | "high",
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
      "dueDate": "YYYY-MM-DD" or null
    }
  ]
}
```

### AI Capabilities
