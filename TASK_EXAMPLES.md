4. **Break Down Complex Tasks**
   - Write one task per line

## Troubleshooting Examples

### Issue: Task not detected
**Problem Input**: "report"
**Why**: Too short, no action verb
**Solution**: "I need to complete the monthly sales report"

### Issue: Wrong priority
**Problem Input**: "maybe update the docs sometime"
**Result**: Medium priority (should be low)
**Solution**: "LOW PRIORITY: Update documentation when free"

### Issue: Multiple tasks combined
**Problem Input**: "Do email and meeting and report"
**Why**: Lacks structure
**Solution**: Use numbered list:
```
1. Send project update email
2. Schedule team meeting
3. Complete weekly report
```
